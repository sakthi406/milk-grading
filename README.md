# milk-grading
 This dataset is manually collected from observations. It helps us to build machine learning models to predict quality of milk. This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, Color. Generally, Grade or Quality of the milk depends on these parameters. These parameters plays a vital role in predictive analysis of the milk.  Usage. Target variable is nothing but Grade of the milk . It can be  0 ( Bad ) 0.5 ( Moderate) 1 ( Good ) if Taste , Odor, Fat, Turbidity are satisfies optimal conditions then they will assign 1 otherwise 0. Temperature and ph are given their actual values in the dataset.  We have to perform data preprocessing, data augmentation techniques to build statistical and predictive models to predict the quality of the milk.  Inspiration To leverage the benefits of machine learning in the dairy industry.
